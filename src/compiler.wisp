  with the syntax of refer-clojure/require/use/import/load/gen-class
  respectively, except the arguments are unevaluated and need not be
  quoted. (:gen-class ...), when supplied, defaults to :name
  corresponding to the ns name, :main true, :impl-ns same as ns, and
  :init-impl-ns true. All options of gen-class are
  supported. The :gen-class directive is ignored when not
  compiling. If :gen-class is not supplied, when compiled only an
  nsname__init.class will be generated. If :refer-clojure is not used, a
  default (refer 'clojure) is used. Use of ns is preferred to
  individual calls to in-ns/require/use/import:

  (ns foo.bar
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [ancestors printf])
  (:require (clojure.contrib sql combinatorics))
  (:use (my.lib this that))
  (:import (java.util Date Timer Random)
