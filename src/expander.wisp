  returned if no clause matches. If no default expression is provided

  Unlike cond and condp, case does a constant-time dispatch, the

  expressions are acceptable in case, including numbers, strings,
  symbols, keywords, and composites thereof. Note that since
  lists are used to group multiple constants that map to the same
