See the [online generator](https://constellation.github.io/escodegen/demo/index.html)\nfor a demo.\n\n\n### Install\n\nEscodegen can be used in a web browser:\n\n    <script src=\"escodegen.browser.js\"></script>\n\nescodegen.browser.js can be found in tagged revisions on GitHub.\n\nOr in a Node.js application via npm:\n\n    npm install escodegen\n\n### Usage\n\nA simple example: the program\n\n    escodegen.generate({\n        type: 'BinaryExpression',\n        operator: '+',\n        left: { type: 'Literal', value: 40 },\n        right: { type: 'Literal', value: 2 }\n    });\n\nproduces the string `'40 + 2'`.\n\nSee the [API page](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen/wiki/API) for\noptions. To run the tests, execute `npm test` in the root directory.\n\n### Building browser bundle / minified browser bundle\n\nAt first, execute `npm install` to install the all dev dependencies.\nAfter that,\n\n    npm run-script build\n\nwill generate `escodegen.browser.js`, which can be used in browser environments.\n\nAnd,\n\n    npm run-script build-min\n\nwill generate the minified file `escodegen.browser.min.js`.\n\n### License\n\n#### Escodegen\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 [Yusuke Suzuki](http://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](http://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.
